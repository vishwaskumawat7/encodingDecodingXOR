# Text Encoding/Decoding using XOR Algorithm

## Run the program

### Encoding/Decoding any string of your choice
- You have to either open the terminal or any IDE from the program root folder or navigate to the directory.
- To encode the string - 
    - You have to run the file using `python3 main.py --encode` command. 
    - It will then ask you to enter the `text` you want to encode and after you press enter it will then ask you for the `key`.
    - It will then give you an encoded string as output.
- To decode the string - 
    - You have to run the file using `python3 main.py --decode` command. 
    - It will then ask you to enter the `text` you want to decode and after you press enter it will then ask you for the `key`.
    - `key` should be same which you entered during encoding otherwise you might get different results.
    - It will then give you the decoded string as output.

### Encoding/Decoding the predefined test cases
- You have to either open the terminal or any IDE from the program root folder or navigate to the directory.
- To encode the string - 
    - You have to run the file using `python3 test_encoding.py --encode` command. 
    - It will then automatically extract content written in different input files and print the encoded strings.
- To decode the string - 
    - You have to run the file using `python3 test_decoding.py --decode` command. 
    - It will then automatically extract content written in different input files and print the decoded strings.
